# ReservoirFinder
`ReservoirFinder` is a centralized database of wildlife reservoirs for multi-host infectious pathogens. This database originated from a study aiming to predict unknown carnivore and bat rabies reservoirs: Worsley-Tonks KEL, Escobar LE, Biek R, Castaneda M, Craft ME, Streicker DG, White LA, Fountain-Jones NM. Using host traits to predict reservoir host species of rabies virus. *PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases*. 

## Description
`ReservoirFinder` is a centralized database that aims to provide a location for researchers to deposit data gathered on wildlife reservoir status (reservoir vs. not a reservoir) for any type of multi-host pathogen. Likewise, the database aims to act as a data source for researchers to ask questions related to the reservoir status of various wildlife species. 

## Data access and availability
* Wildlife traits and disease reservoir status data collection is ongoing and will continuously be updated by members of the scientific community.
* Current data  includes a list of most carnivore species (N = 277) and bat species from the Americas (N = 326) and associated life-history and ecological traits (obtained from the PanTHERIA database: Jones et al. 2009), and their associated rabies reservoir status (reservoir = 1, not a reservoir or no information on reservoir status = 0) (Worsley-Tonks et al. *PLOS Neglected Tropical Disease*).
* Researchers are encouraged to deposit reservoir status data for any type of: 
+ multi-host pathogen (e.g., Avian Influenza, Bovine Tuberculosis, Leptospira),
+ host taxa (e.g., birds, rodents, ruminants), and 
+ associated host traits.
